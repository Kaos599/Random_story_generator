# Random_story_generator

This is a simple random story generator game written in Python. The game asks the user to enter some words to fill in the blanks of a story. The result is a funny and nonsensical story.

## How to play
To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To run the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the file Madlibs.py. Then type python Madlibs.py and press enter.

The game will start with a welcome message and ask you to enter some words to fill in the blanks of the story. The words are of different types, such as adjective, noun, verb, etc. You can enter any word you want, as long as it matches the type.

The game will then print the final story with your words inserted in the blanks. You can read and enjoy the story.

## How to modify
You can modify the game by changing the code in the file Madlibs.py. You can change the story template, the list of words to ask for, or the logic of the game as you wish.

For example, you can change the story template by editing the string variable story. You can use curly braces {} as placeholders for the words to fill in. You can also use positional arguments {0}, {1}, etc. or named arguments {name}, {verb}, etc. to refer to specific words.

You can change the list of words to ask for by editing the list variable words. You can add or remove any word type you want, as long as it matches the number and order of placeholders in the story template.

You can change the logic of the game by editing the print statements, input statements, or str.format method. You can also use other methods or functions to get or process the userâ€™s input or output.
